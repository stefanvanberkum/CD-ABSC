another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital $T$s , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying .

at double-speed ( 2x $T$ speed ) , it still plays mp3s with sound -- they are pitch-corrected and smooth , but twice as fast !

weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the $T$ are only so-so ; it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names ; you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1/2x , etc . ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ] .

i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd $T$ that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category .

there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open ( my prev . machine did it automatically ) , and the fact that the $T$ is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance .
