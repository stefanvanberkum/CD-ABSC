like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent $T$ and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) .

i find it pretty easy to use ... and unlike the remote $T$ for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) .. .

the cons are n't really a big deal to me ... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files ... no $T$ ... and it 's based on the title of the songs ... many of my songs where seperated into folders ( on the pc ) ... and a few had same titles ... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another .
folder structure

and man ... i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player ... because i had the actual $T$s of the songs as the title ..

the $T$ is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product .

the included $T$ support is useful at times , especially when you listen to a variety of genres , as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle .

the $T$ ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods .

if you hold down the $T$ too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get `` stuck `` rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it .

finally the $T$ used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best .

1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's `` unspecified `` ratio ) and good $T$ allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .
power output
1
with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the $T$ is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) .
volume

the $T$ works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers .

3 ) the $T$ ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player .

the $T$ provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad .

5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable $T$ ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's $T$ which costs $ 100 to replace .

8 ) creative $T$ , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service ( gracenotes ) .
mediasource

i do n't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of $T$s .

b. fast mediasource $T$ping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2.4 ghz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive .

c. i do love audio $T$ which allows a one-click $T$hronization between the player and the music collection on the computer .
sync

9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to $T$ and play selected music at a specified time .
wake up
1
10 ) multiple $T$s - tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc . , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter .
play mode
1
11 ) minimal $T$ between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player
pause

12 ) big $T$ - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) !
storage
1
1 ) player is not $T$ - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it .
plug and play
-1
2 ) music organization is based on $T$ ( by genre , artist , album , etc . ) and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect $T$ information .

3 ) $T$s can not be created for the audio files .

4 ) no $T$ or voice recording - these would have been nice extras .

7 ) some people have problems with the $T$ on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch .

usb 2.0

minor complaints : 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player , the option to search for music contained in a $T$ is unavailable .

-1
the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the $T$ name .

2 ) having unfilled $T$s will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called `` unknown . ``

3 ) with mediasource being so easy , i found no use for the bundled $T$ software .

feedback on creative 's product $T$ is universally poor ; this is not limited to the zen , it applies to all the company 's products .
support
-1
the $T$ is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the device .
scroll wheel
-1
the creative $T$ is awkward / difficult to use and just plain does n't load on some computers .
software
-1
enough people have reported that their $T$ does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .
headphone jack
-1
the zen does n't support $T$s so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that `` creates `` $T$s , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best .

possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the $T$ him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new $T$ .
battery
1
since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the $T$ replacement ) .
