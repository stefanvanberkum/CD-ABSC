i recently purchased the $T$ and am extremely satisfied with the purchase .

the camera is very easy to $T$ , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group .

they fired away and the $T$ turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my $T$s have thusfar ) .

a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for $T$ .

i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no visable loss in $T$ and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) .

bottom line , well made $T$ , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices .

this is my first digital $T$ , and what a ' toy ' it is !

just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the $T$s a touch of brilliance .

whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of $T$ and functionality goes together .

the g3 is loaded with many useful $T$s , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .
feature

the lens is visible in the $T$ when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .

i have only had this $T$ for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful .
camera
1
the $T$ is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features .
photo quality
1
the reason i rated it a four is because of that $T$ . its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )
darn diopter adjustment dial

1 ) slr like programming and $T$ gives you latitude to be creative , yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings .

it 's great to switch to $T$ and actually see it working on the lcd screen .

you can move the $T$ range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual $T$ mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically $T$ .

with a quick spin of the $T$ you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality .

i chose the $T$ because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .
g3

the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long $T$ before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .
lag time

flash
-1
what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme $T$ of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .
depth
1
relative to what i can easily achieve with external $T$ on my nikon slr , the internal $T$ on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .
flash
-1
contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party $T$es , just as it does with the dedicated $T$es from canon .
flash
1
now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the $T$ that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !
software
-1
the canon $T$ for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera .
software
-1
what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw $T$ hardware .
g3
1
without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the $T$s are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !
color
1
the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of $T$ .
software
-1
what the g3 raw image $T$ gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .
software
-1
but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic $T$s ive ever seen from a camera .

1
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the $T$s i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .

3 . the remote capture and fileviewer $T$ bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .

4 . the $T$ of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .
shape

you could take a $T$ of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right .

8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper $T$s .
white offset
1
overall , the $T$ delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .
