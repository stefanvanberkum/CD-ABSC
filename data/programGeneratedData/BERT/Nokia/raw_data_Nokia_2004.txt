i have had the phone for 1 week , the $T$ has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at & # 38 ; t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route .

it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the $T$s and the pim ( personal information manager -- i.e . organizer ) , and the radio !

the $T$ on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --

the $T$s on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly .

the $T$ are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) .

i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when $T$s never worked .

apparently , $T$ is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands .

in all fairness , $T$s are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .

t-mobile is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good $T$ 's .

however , the $T$s constantly drop in my area and i experince mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line .

this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm $T$ tuner built in .

this $T$ receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal $T$ , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's $T$ should work perfectly .

another benefit of this $T$ is that it is truly an international $T$ ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .

unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer $T$ like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .

the $T$ also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection .

the $T$ connection is sometimes slow , and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain , but the other t-zones applications are quite useful .

one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n't updated their $T$ system to fully support the 6610 .

the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the $T$s and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .

the $T$ functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network .
